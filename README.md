# ESD-Project-8.6 Placement Student Application
Allow a student to login and view all offers for which they are eligible by checking their domain, specialisation and their cgpa. Ask the student to upload their CV for application and also store other information automatically such as grade and other needed details. Also display the result of the application if the student opted for the placement. Students cannot apply for another application if they are already placed. The student should be able to view the history of applications they applied for.
